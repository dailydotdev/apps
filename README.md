This monorepo contains daily.dev's application suite. The repo includes the web app and the extension, along with shared components for the two.
The decision was made to allow faster iterations and to keep features parity in both platforms.

## Technology

* NPM for managing dependencies.
* Node v14.16.1 (a `.nvmrc` is presented for [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) users).
* [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for managing the monorepo.

## Projects

### eslint-config

Shared settings for eslint for all the projects in this repo.

### extension

The browser extension project. Includes webpack configuration for browser extensions and the dedicated components just for the extension.

### prettier-config

Shared settings for prettier for all the projects in this repo.

### shared

The main project with most of the components that are used in the applications. Every component that need to be used in both platforms should be placed in this project. This includes the design system components, custom hooks, and many more.

### webapp

The web app project. It is a Next.js project and it has more pages than the extension. Such as registration page, article page, profile page, etc.
