Yet influencers on X will tell you this is just ChatGPT with a cron job. Get your own AI employee and change your life",

Cursor is dissolving the barriers. but this is not about replacing programmers with agents. not about pumping out more of the same SaaS apps faster.\n\nthis is a renaissance, not a factory.\n\nanyone with an idea can now make software (in theory). but now the tools are no longer the true bottleneck. we are.\n\nthe impossible became possible. things that took months now take hours. the constraint shifted from technical ability to clarity of intention. the question is no longer \"can this be built?\" but \"what should be built?\"\n\nthe tools are ready. the question is: are you?",

Use claude --agent and \"coach\" my agents by updating their .md files. (The \"sub\" in \"subagents\" limits creativity, so I avoid saying \"sub\" now.)\nP: Git worktrees, but with opinionated tooling on top to reduce agent mistakes.\nA: Hooks to eliminate permission prompts but check commands more thoroughly\nC and E: Spend time improving CLIs, not just getting the job done once. Make CLIs do more work than models over time. You'll decrease token usage/auto-compaction that way too!",

Oliver opens terminal, types \"claude\" in his project folder, and it becomes his coach. He edits code in his IDE, wires circuits at his desk, and talks to the coach when he's stuck or wants ideas.\n\nRepo design in my original post. Whipped this up in an hour and was blown away at how delightful the experience was watching Oliver over his shoulder. We had to drag him to bed last night.\n\nQuestions I'm still thinking about:\n* Is there a business here? Or just a parenting hack?\n* Would a TUI app (terminal for kids) be crazy or genius?\n* What is other interesting art in this space I should be exploring?",
