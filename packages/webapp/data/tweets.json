    "text": "What happens when your codebase is self-driving?\n\nWe don't know yet, but our early research is fascinating to me. Running coding agents for weeks only *kind of* works right now. Still experimental.\n\nI wouldn't expect anyone to build a production system like this. But the rate of improvement is worth paying attention to, and I think on the order of years, this will have a massive impact on how software is built.\n\nTo be extra clear, I don't recommend that you try to use this today. First off it's expensive, and secondly people are still adjusting to the current capabilities of coding agents. Working with these long-running harnesses requires a different style of building software.\n\nBut this is, in my opinion, a fascinating read and glimpse into the future. And it's oddly poetic. In some ways, it feels like discovering how to build software systems again from first principles, and then being surprised that it actually looks pretty similar to how many software teams work today.\n\nI was chuckling along at parts like this:\n\n> There were hundreds of workers and one gate (i.e. \"red tape\") that all work must pass through. We tried prompt changes, but ultimately decided it was unnecessarily and could be removed to simplify the system.\n\nHuh, that sure sounds familiar...\n\n> Workers pick up tasks and are solely responsible for driving them to completion. They're unaware of the larger system. They don't communicate with any other planners or workers. They work on their own copy of the repo, and when done, they write up a single handoff that the system submits to the planner that requested the task.\n\n...Is this play about us?\n\nWe'll be rolling out access to this slowly for other people to try out. And continuing to do more research here!\n\nBlog: https://t.co/pvZfbkoy9h",

Last week, I was observing a group of users onboarding onto Claude Code. I saw that when something unexpected occurred, it wasn't easy for us to figure out the cause from the limited TUI display. Meanwhile, it was a chore to locate the logs. What if we simply gave Claude access to it from within the TUI?",

This hasn't always been the case in my career. This is also due in part from hiring strong generalists.\n\nYou could call this an \"AI native company\" possibly, and certainly heavy use of AI for all parts of knowledge work does make it easier for a single IC to ship something end-to-end, but it's probably something deeper culturally.\n\nBut leaders at Cursor don't devise a grand scheme in isolation and then emerge from the shadows like \"Behold! The roadmap!\". I think this also has tradeoffs (there is no perfect org structure) but it is refreshingly different from how I've worked prior in my career.",

We had to drag him to bed last night.\n\nQuestions I'm still thinking about:\n* Is there a business here?

The rendering engine is from-scratch in Rust with HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, paint, and a custom JS VM.\n\nIt *kind of* works! It still has issues and is of course very far from Webkit/Chromium parity, but we were astonished that simple websites render quickly and largely correctly.",

Use claude --agent and \"coach\" my agents by updating their .md files. (The \"sub\" in \"subagents\" limits creativity, so I avoid saying \"sub\" now.)\nP: Git worktrees, but with opinionated tooling on top to reduce agent mistakes.\nA: Hooks to eliminate permission prompts but check commands more thoroughly\nC and E: Spend time improving CLIs, not just getting the job done once. Make CLIs do more work than models over time. You'll decrease token usage/auto-compaction that way too!",
